I get the following errors:

Failed attempt: 1 must be string or read-only buffer, not file
Failed attempt: 2 __exit__
Failed attempt: 3 argument must have 'read' and 'readline' attributes
Failed attempt: 4 argument must have 'read' and 'readline' attributes
Failed attempt: 5 argument must have 'read' and 'readline' attributes
Hopefully this is just some obvious (to someone else) fix that I am just missing. Thanks for your help!

The errors you are getting on attempts 3-5 are because you're using pickle.load instead of pickle.loads. The former expects a file-like object, rather than the byte string you're getting from the decompression calls.

This will work:

with open('test.gz', 'rb') as fp:
       data = zlib.decompress(fp.read())
       successDict = pickle.loads(data)
